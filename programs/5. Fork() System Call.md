# Basic fork() System Call
The `fork()` system call is used to create a new process in Linux. This system call creates a child process that is a duplicate of the parent process. The child process is an exact copy of the parent process, with a separate process ID and with its own copy of the parent's data and heap.

Here is an example code that demonstrates the use of the `fork()` system call:

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  pid_t pid;

  // Create a child process
  pid = fork();

  if (pid == 0) {
    // This is the child process
    cout << "Child process: pid = " << getpid() << endl;
  } else if (pid > 0) {
    // This is the parent process
    cout << "Parent process: pid = " << getpid() << endl;
  } else {
    // Error occurred during the fork call
    cout << "Fork call failed" << endl;
    return 1;
  }

  return 0;
}

```

This code demonstrates the basic use of the `fork()` system call. It creates a child process by calling the `fork()` function and the `pid_t` data type is used to store the process ID returned by the `fork()` call. The parent process and child process each print a message indicating their process ID. If the `fork()` call fails, the code will output an error message.
