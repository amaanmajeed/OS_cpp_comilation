# Exit System Call in C
The exit system call in C is used to terminate a process and exit the program. It performs necessary cleanup operations before ending the program, such as flushing buffers and closing connections.

### Syntax:
```cpp
void exit (int exit_code);
```

where `exit_code` is the value returned to the parent process.

### Example

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    cout << "Start Program" << endl;
    exit(0);
    cout << "End Program" << endl;
    return(0);
}
```

Output:
```
Start Program
```


In this example, the exit system call is used to end the program and return an exit code of 0 to the parent process. Note that any code after the exit call will not be executed.
