The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a collection of compilers and libraries for C, C++. 
Many open-source projects, including the GNU tools and the Linux kernel, are compiled with 
GCC.
To able to add new repositories and install packages on your Ubuntu system, you must be logged 
in as root or user with sudo privileges.

## Installing G++ on Ubuntu

The default Ubuntu repositories contain a meta-package named build-essential that 
contains the GCC compiler and a lot of libraries and other utilities required for compiling 
software.

1. Start by updating the packages list:
```bash
$ sudo apt update
```

2. Install the build-essential package by typing:
```bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential
```

3. Check the version of g++ compiler by following command.
```bash
$ g++ --version
```
