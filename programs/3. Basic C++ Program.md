# Basic C++ Program

This is a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console in C++.

## Steps to Run the Program
1. Create a text file named `hello.cpp` and copy the following code into the file:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where hello.cpp is located.

3. Compile the code by running the following command:
```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
```

4. Run the executable file by using this command:
```bash
./hello
```

This will print "Hello, World!" to the console.
