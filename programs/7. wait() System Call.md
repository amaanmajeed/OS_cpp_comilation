# Wait System Call
A wait system call is used to block the execution of the parent process until one of its child processes terminates. In the example below, we will demonstrate the usage of the wait system call.

## Example Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
    int pid = fork();

    if(pid == 0){
        // I am the child process
        cout << "I am a child process and my PID is : " << getpid() << endl;
        exit(0);
    }else if (pid > 0){
        // I am the parent process
        int cpid = wait(NULL);
        cout << "I am a parent process and my PID is: " << getpid() << endl;
        cout << "My Child PID is: " << cpid << endl;
    }else{
        cout << "Error in forking" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```


## Output
```
I am a child process and my PID is : 7593
I am a parent process and my PID is: 7592
My Child PID is: 7593
```


### Explanation:

- In the above code, the parent process first calls the `fork` system call to create a child process.
- The return value of `fork` is stored in the `pid` variable.
- If `pid` is equal to `0`, then the process is a child process. The child process then prints its PID and calls the `exit` system call with a status code of `0`.
- If `pid` is greater than `0`, then the process is the parent process. The parent process then calls the `wait` system call and stores the PID of the terminated child process in the `cpid` variable. The parent process then prints its PID and the PID of the child process.
- If `pid` is less than `0`, then there was an error in creating a child process, and an error message is printed.

With this example code, we can observe the use of the wait system call in a parent-child process relationship. The wait system call blocks the execution of the parent process until the child process terminates, and the parent process continues its execution after the wait system call.


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <time.h>
using namespace std;

int main (){
int ppid = getpid();
int pidl = fork();
int pid2 = fork();
if (ppid == getpid()){
    int cpid = waitpid(pid2,NULL,0);
    cout << "I am a parent process "
    <<"and my PID is: " << getpid()<<endl;
    cout << "My Child PID is: " << cpid << endl;
}
else if (pid2==0 && pidl !=0)
{
    cout << "Chlld process "<< getpld() <<" 1s sleeping.\n";
    sleep(5);
    cout << "Child process "<< getpid() <<" is awake.\n";
}else{
    cout << "I am a child process and my PID is : " << getpid();
    cout << endl;
}
return 0;
}
add this as example code
